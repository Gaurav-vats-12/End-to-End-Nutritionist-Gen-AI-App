# End to End Nutritionist Gen AI App
 - In this project I have built an app that calculates the total calories from a food image provided and tell whether it's good to eat the food or not.

## NOTICE!!
 - Due to Deprecation of Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision from Google AI for Developers I've changed the model to `gemini-1.5-flash`. And at the moment this model can't analyse images.But, you can have a look at the implementation code.
